# Information
This code trains a Deep-Q-Network to play the game Pong. It lets you compete against the DQN. It works with both Matlab and Octave (6.2.0). It does not require advanced packages. See README.md for instructions.
The code was my project for the 2021 AG 'Theory and Implementation of Deep Learning Algorithms' with supervisor Prof. Dr. Alfio Borzi at the University of WÃ¼rzburg.

The code can train two (2 Layer) neural networks to play Pong against each other 
as well as human vs neural network.

# How to train and to play:
RunDQN.m    trains two Networks (Agent1, Agent2) by playing Pong against each other. Has to be executed before running the following.

TestRun.m   displays 5 games either played randomly (random=true) or by the agents (random = false).

Pong.m      lets you play Pong against Agent2
